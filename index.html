            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>Dash</h3>
            Dash, or the THON™ Weekend Dashboard, is an event management application fully developed by THON™ Technology Captains. The application is the backbone of THON™ Weekend, a 46-hour dance marathon raising money for pediatric cancer research and treatment. Dash controlled building capacity, fire code compliance, tracking the well-bring of volunteers and supporters, and regulations compliance. As a Technology Captain, we continuously improved and maintained the website leading up to and during the event. I self-identified multiple accessibility issues with the website that prevented a large population of volunteers from being able to use the core features. After informing my superiors, I led a multi-team initiative to overhaul Dash’s frontend and make all pages more accessible for screen readers and other common accessibility tools. After completing the Dash overhaul, I was tasked with modifying many of our features into mobile-friendly webpages. This project was key for THON 2022 as we received a donation of smartphones with barcode readers. In past events, volunteers used tablets to manually type in spectator wristband information. With a shortened timeline, I successfully changed the core features to be more efficient and compatible with smartphones, with or without a built-in barcode reader. During THON™ Weekend, I was responsible for ensuring accurate capacity calculations and live troubleshooting for all 46 hours. I ensured that DASH was operating at peak efficiency for our spectators and families.        </p>
            <h3>Polls</h3>
            <p>Polls is a texting based live event polling application built for THON™ events. What started as an off-handed comment from another team turned into one of the largest applications created for THON™. As team lead, I worked with the Entertainment committee to create an outline for the application. Once we had a set plan and all stakeholders agreed on the specifics, I worked with my team to design and build the application from scratch. I created many of the core features such as the connection to Twillio, efficient and accurate tallying of votes, and support for multiple permission groups. The application was used throughout multiple THON™ events and handled over 10,000 votes per poll.</p>
            <h3>POST</h3>
            <p>POST is the Point-Of-Sale Technology for THON™. It handles all merchandise sales and orders and is primarily used by the Merchandise committee. As the Project Lead for the site, I undertook and lead my team in a massive POST overhaul. For years, POST’s inventory system was forgotten about and left the Merchandise team without a way to audit their inventory. My team rewrote this system, Warewolf, and gave POST new life as a more streamlined and efficient system. Purchases are processed faster with our API and frontend updates. The biggest POST update happened when customers complained of long checkout times. After user feedback sessions and live testing, I identified the root cause of the checkout times to our receipt system. Before, customers had to give their email address to a volunteer for a receipt. In noisy environments, email addresses had to be retyped many times, further slowing down the process. I completely rewrote our receipt generation algorithm and moved receipts to be displayed on a public page, instead of behind THON’s™ authentication. I also introduced the ability to text the receipt link to customers instead of email, which greatly reduced checkout times and increased customer satisfaction.</p>
            <h3>Warewolf</h3>
            <p>Warewolf is THON’s™ inventory management application. Primarily built for the Merchandise committee, it flourished into being a THON™ wide application used by all committees under my leadership. I reduced inventory load times by 500% with new algorithms and better quantity calculations. POST became more connected with Warewolf and relied on the site more for product information and prices to avoid price mismatches, making Warewolf the single point of truth for the Merchandise committee. The biggest change to Warewolf happened when I redid the frontend and backend permissions module. This simple change to unify how the site checks permissions was implemented into the rest of THON’s™ applications. I also introduced low quantity notifications, reducing the need for manual quantity checks at stores and ensuring a location always had resources.</p>
